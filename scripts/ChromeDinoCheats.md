Type the following command in Console and press enter. You can use any other speed in place of 1000.

```



#### Immortality

After every command press enter. All the commands are case-sensitive.

We store the original game over function in a variable:

```js
var original = Runner.prototype.gameOver
```

Then, we make the game over function empty:

```js
Runner.prototype.gameOver = function(){}
```

When you want to stop the game, Revert back to the original game over function:

```js
Runner.prototype.gameOver = original
```



#### Setting the current score

Letâ€™s set the score to 12345. You can set any other score less than 99999. The current score is reset on game over.

Runner.instance_.distanceRan = 12345 / Runner.instance_.distanceMeter.config.COEFFICIENT
```
