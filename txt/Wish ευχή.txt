Wish ευχή

There’s this website that’s been quite popular lately. It’s called “ευχή”(efchí), a Greek term which means “Wish”. It is said that if you make a wish on the website, it will come true. I’ve never believed in such nonsense. But some of my friends tried it and they said it worked. But they are disappearing… one after another. Anyone who made a wish on the website just… disappeared…

	This can’t be real. But my friends… they’re just gone. I should do something about it. Jake sent me the link a few days ago, before he disappeared. Maybe I should check it out. As I thought, it’s similar to those previous websites. On the website, there’s an input bar with the sentence “Make a wish and it shall come true.” There’s a feeling that I should make a wish… I think I should do it.

	I made a wish - “I wish I could find out the truth.” A pop-out message box appeared: “Your wish has been granted.” Okay… nothing happens. Is this a prank or something? But that doesn’t explain the disappearing people… If all of these were real, I would have disappeared too, but I have not. The only thing I feel is hungriness. I should get something to eat.

	“Mom, can you make me some sandwiches? Mom?” Why is she ignoring me? I’ll make them on my own I guess. Wait… did my hand just go through the bread like I’m invisible? I can’t touch anything… “Mom! Help me! Mom?! Can you hear me?!” What is going on here? Wait… the website… all the disappearing people… It all makes sense now. They didn’t really disappear… and my wish… has been granted.

-END-

	“Hey…you wished for something too? You should have done that… I…I shouldn’t have sent you the link…” “Jake…?”
